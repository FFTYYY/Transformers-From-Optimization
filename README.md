The code to reproduce all experiment results of Neurips 2022 paper "Transformers from an Optimization Perspective".

well I admit the code is kind of disorder now, I will make them more organized later.


-----

To reproduce all the experiments in the paper:
```
# Figure 1
python appllo_circle.py

# Figure 2 and 3
python combination_energy.py

# Figure 4
python divergence.py

# Figure 5 and 6
cd energy_curve
python main.py
```
